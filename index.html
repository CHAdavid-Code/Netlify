                Scarface is a 1983 American crime drama film directed by Brian
                De Palma and written by Oliver Stone. Loosely based on the 1929
                novel of the same name and serving as a loose remake of the 1932
                film, it tells the story of Cuban refugee Tony Montana (Al
                Pacino), who arrives penniless in Miami during the Mariel
                boatlift and becomes a powerful and extremely homicidal drug
                lord. The film co-stars Steven Bauer, Michelle Pfeiffer, Mary
                Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Robert Loggia.De Palma dedicated this
                version of Scarface to the writers of the original film, Howard
                Hawks and Ben Hecht.

                Pacino became interested in a remake of the 1932 version after
                seeing it, and he and producer Martin Bregman began to develop
                it. Sidney Lumet was initially hired to direct the film but was
                replaced by De Palma, who hired Stone to write the script.
                Filming took place from November 1982 to May 1983, in Los
                Angeles and Miami. The film's soundtrack was composed by Giorgio
                Moroder.

                Scarface premiered in New York City on December 1, 1983, and was
                released on December 9 by Universal Pictures. The film grossed
                $45 million at the domestic box office and $66 million
                worldwide. Initial critical reception was negative due to its
                excessive violence, profanity, and graphic drug usage. Some
                Cuban expatriates in Miami objected to the film's portrayal of
                Cubans as criminals and drug traffickers. In the years that
                followed, critics have reappraised it, and it is now considered
                one of the greatest gangster films ever made. Screenwriters and
                directors such as Martin Scorsese have praised the film, and it
                has been referenced extensively in pop culture, especially in
                hip hop music, as well as comic books, television programs, and
                video games. The film has come to be regarded as a cult classic.
